Repository for CS12 - Web Systems &amp; Technologies, BSCS-3B1

Hello, I am Jurgen Dominic I. Pacaña from BSCS-3B1. I live at Visapa Homes, Brgy. Irawan, PPC I love scifi movies and metroidvania games. I enrolled into this program because I felt that it aligned with my interests the most amongst the other programs available to Palawan State University—I am quite content with this choice as it led me to meet my best-friends within the same field as I am.
